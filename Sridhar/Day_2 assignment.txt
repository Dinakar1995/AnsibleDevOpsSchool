Can you please convert this INI inventory format to yaml inventory format and use it

mail.example.com

&#91;webservers]
foo.example.com
bar.example.com

&#91;dbservers]
one.example.com
two.example.com
three.example.com

Workaround

ansible-inventory -i inventory -y --list > inventory.yaml

all:
  children:
    ungrouped:
      hosts:
        '&': {}
        bar.example.com: {}
        foo.example.com: {}
        mail.example.com: {}
        one.example.com: {}
        three.example.com: {}
        two.example.com: {}
